This project consists of three tasks, implemented in JavaScript, to manipulate arrays and create user profiles.

Task 1: arrayManipulation.js

processArray: This function takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

formatArrayStrings: This function takes an array of strings and an array of numbers. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd

Task 2: userInfo.js
createUserProfiles: This function takes an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 1. It returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.
